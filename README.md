# mock-rock
Exemplary repository to demonstrate the expected structure of the ROCK repositories within this organization.

Feel free to use this repository as a template for structuring your own ROCK repository. The `mock-rock` is not a public ROCK, but instead a dummy repository to mock a real ROCK repository. The organization's workflows perform dry-runs against this `mock-rock` to ensure the CI/CD pipelines are functional and healthy.
